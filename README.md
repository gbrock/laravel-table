This package contains flexible ways of rendering Eloquent collections as dynamic HTML tables.  This includes
techniques for sortable columns, customizable cell data, automatic pagination, ~~user-definable rows-per-page, batch 
action handling, and extensible filtering~~ (coming soon).


## Installation

Require the package in your `composer.json`:

```json
"gbrock/laravel-table": "dev-master"
```

Add the service provider to `config/app.php` and, optionally, the Facade:

```php
'Gbrock\Table\Providers\TableServiceProvider',
...
'Table'      => 'Gbrock\Table\Facades\Table',
```

Publish the views and config:

```
php artisan vendor:publish
```

## Usage

**In order to render an HTML table of Eloquent models into a view**, first create a Table object, passing in your
 model collection (this could be done in your controller, repository, or any service class):
 
 ```php
 $rows = User::get(); // Get all users from the database
 $table = Table::create($rows); // Generate a Table based on these "rows"
 ```
 
 Then pass that object to your view:

```php
return view('users.index', ['table' => $table]);
```

In your view, the table object can be rendered using unescaped syntax:

```php
{!! $table !!}
```

Which would render something like this:

### Sorting

To add links in your headers which sort the indicated column, add the `Sortable` trait to your model.  Since no 
fields are allowed to be sorted by default (for security reasons), also add a `sortable` array containing allowed fields.

```php
use Gbrock\Table\Traits\Sortable;

class User extends Model {

	use Sortable;
	
    /**
     * The attributes which may be used for sorting dynamically.
     *
     * @var array
     */
    protected $sortable = ['username', 'email', 'created_at'];
```

This adds the `sortable` scope to your model, which you should use when retrieving rows.  Altering our example,
`$rows = User::get()` becomes:

 ```php
 $rows = User::sorted()->get(); // Get all users from the database, but listen to the user Request and sort accordingly
```

Now, our table will be rendered with links in the header:

![Sortable example](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/gbrock/laravel-table/master/examples/images/sortable_initialization.png)

The links will contain query strings like `?sort=username&direction=asc`.

### Pagination

If you paginate your Eloquent collection, it will automatically be rendered below the table:

 ```php
 $rows = User::sorted()->paginate(); // Get all users from the database, sort, and paginate
```

## Customization

### Columns

Pass in a second argument to your database call / Table creation, **columns**:

```php
 $table = Table::create($rows, ['username', 'created_at']); // Generate a Table based on these "rows"
```


### Cells

You can specify a closure to use when rendering cell data when adding the column:

```php
// We pass in the field, label, and a callback accepting the model data of the row it's currently rendering
$table->addColumn('created_at', 'Added', function($model) {
    return $model->created_at->diffForHumans();
});
```

Also, since the table is accessing our model's attributes, we can add or modify any column key we'd like by using
[accessors](http://laravel.com/docs/5.0/eloquent#accessors-and-mutators):

```php
    protected function getRenderedCreatedAtAttribute()
    {
        // We access the following diff string with "$model->rendered_created_at"
        return $this->created_at->diffForHumans();
    }
```

The default view favors the `rendered_foobar` attribute, if present, otherwise it uses the `foobar` attribute.

### View

A copy of the view file is located in `/resources/vendor/gbrock/tables/` after you've run `php artisan vendor:publish`.
You can copy this file wherever you'd like and alter it, then tell your table to use the new view:

```php
$table->setView('users.table');
```
